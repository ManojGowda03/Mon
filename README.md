# Solar Panel Fault Detection using CNN

This project is focused on classifying various types of faults in solar panels using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to automate the detection of common issues such as dust, physical damage, and electrical damage that impact the efficiency of solar panels.

## Project Overview

* *Objective*: Develop a deep learning model that classifies solar panel images into specific fault categories.
* *Methodology*: A custom CNN is trained from scratch to recognize visual patterns associated with different fault types.
* *Platform*: Developed and tested in Google Colab using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Dataset Details

The dataset contains labeled images of solar panels across six categories:

* *Bird-drop*
* *Clean*
* *Dusty*
* *Electrical-damage*
* *Physical-Damage*
* *Snow-Covered*

## Model Architecture

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used with the following architecture:

* *Input Shape*: 224 x 224 x 3 RGB images
* *Conv2D + MaxPooling + Dropout* layers (3 blocks)
* *Flatten*
* *Dense Layer (ReLU)*
* *Output Layer*: 6 neurons with Softmax activation (for 6 classes)

The model is compiled with:

* *Loss Function*: categorical_crossentropy
* *Optimizer*: adam
* *Metrics*: accuracy

---

## Training Summary

* *Training Accuracy*: ~99%
* *Validation Accuracy*: ~93%
* *Test Accuracy*: ~93.27%
* *Smooth training convergence*, minimal overfitting

Training and validation graphs (accuracy and loss) are included in the notebook.

---

## Evaluation and Results

The notebook includes:

* *Classification Report*: Precision, Recall, F1-score for each class
* *Confusion Matrix*
* *Visual Predictions*: Random test images with predicted and true labels

The model performs well across all fault categories, demonstrating strong generalization on unseen data.
